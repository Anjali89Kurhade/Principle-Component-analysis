Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
t is a statistical process that converts the observations of correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated features with the help of orthogonal transformation.
PCA helps you interpret your data, but it will not always find the important patterns. Principal component analysis (PCA) simplifies the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns
